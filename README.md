👋 Hi, I’m Paulo Victor

I'm a Full Stack developer passionate about technology with a lot of curiosity about it, I'm always looking for new knowledge in online courses, articles and other different types of sources, so I'm always professionalizing myself more and more, thus increasing my skills and knowledge about technology.

I have a very eclectic style, I enjoy movies, series, comics, anime, among other things...

My hobby is to practice sports, play games (of all styles), read articles related to technology in general and many more things, lol...

Currently the main technologies that I have experience are:
- ⚛️ React
- ⚛️ React Native
- ⬢ Node
- Typescript
